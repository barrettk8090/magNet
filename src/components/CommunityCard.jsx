        <p>I'm an all-around craftsman. I've been making pottery in my downtime, and recently started an Etsy shop. I didn't get much traction there at first, so I used Magnet to connect with small businesses in my city. I ended up connecting with Caitlin, who owns a coffee shop downtown. Now my work is featured in the cafe for purchase, and the word about my work is spreading fast! </p>
