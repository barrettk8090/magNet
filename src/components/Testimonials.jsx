                    <p className="pb-4 text-black font-medium text-2xl">"I recently ended a career in corporate finance to pursue my passion for product photography. </p>
                    <p className="text-black font-medium"> Inititally, I felt lost â€“ I had no idea where to begin. After cold emailing hundreds of businesses with no response, I realized my portfolio needed a facelift. Then, I found out about Magnet, where I was paired with a small beauty brand that was struggling to get their product photos to look perfect. I was able to take photos for them, add those images to my portfolio, and since then, I just got my first paying client! Thanks Magnet!! "</p>

                    <p className="text-black font-medium"> Unfortunately, I'm not very good with computers, and I definitely could not afford spending money on development services in this economy! Luckily, I found Magnet, where I was paired with a software development student who was looking to build websites to get more front-end experience. I couldn't be happier with the end result!"</p>
