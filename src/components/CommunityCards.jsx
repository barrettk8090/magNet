            </div>
            <p>I'm an all-around craftsman. I've been making pottery in my downtime, and recently started an Etsy shop. I didn't get much traction there at first, so I used Magnet to connect with small businesses in my city. I ended up connecting with Caitlin, who owns a coffee shop downtown. Now my work is featured in the cafe for purchase, and the word about my work is spreading fast!!!! </p>

            <p>I connected with Grace on Magnet a few months ago. I recently opened a small independent coffee shop downtown, and I was looking for local artists and makers who might want to feature their creations in the shop. Grace stopped by and we instantly connected, and she's been making & selling pieces for the shop ever since! </p>

            </div>
            <p>I recently completed a graphic design bootcamp, which was great! But once I graduated, I realized I needed to build out my portfolio a bit more. The hardest part was getting my first client with such a minimal portfolio. Then, I downloaded Magnet. I was paired with Bob, who was just starting out a small food truck in my city. He needed a menu designed for the side of his truck, and I was more than happy to help! Now, my art displayed all around town, and I've started getting real paying clients, too!  </p>

            <p>I know a lot about food trucks, and, after working in the industry for years, I decided to start my own. One thing I know nothing about: grpahic design. I tried making a menu design on my own, and it looked terrible. Luckily, I matched with Bob on Magnet, who created an incredible menu design for me! Now my business is really taking off!</p>

            <p>I've been editing videos for fun on my YouTube channel for about a year or two. I wanted to get more involved with the community and help out people in need. I logged into Magnet and was connected with Fred, a football coach at my former high school. They were looking for a video editor for a charity event they were hosting, and I was more than happy to help! I'm really happy with the end result, and the team raised a record amount of money for charity! </p>

            <p>Our football team had a charity event coming up, and I wanted to stitch together some videos we had on hand from the last season. Unfortunately, the school budget is in the red, and we couldn't afford a proper editor. That's when I found Alice on Magnet. I could not be more grateful for her helping us out when we needed it most! </p>
