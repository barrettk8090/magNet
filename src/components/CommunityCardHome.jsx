        <p>I'm an all-around craftsman. I've been making pottery in my downtime, and recently started an Etsy shop. I didn't get much traction there at first, so I used Magnet to connect with small businesses in my city. I ended up connecting with Caitlin, who owns a coffee shop downtown. Now my work is featured in the cafe for purchase, and the word about my work is spreading fast!!!! </p>

        </div>
        <p>I connected with Grace on Magnet a few months ago. I recently opened a small independent coffee shop downtown, and I was looking for local artists and makers who might want to feature their creations in the shop. Grace stopped by and we instantly connected, and she's been making & selling pieces for the shop ever since! </p>
