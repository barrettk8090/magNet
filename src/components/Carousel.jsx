After cold emailing hundreds of businesses with no response, I realized my portfolio needed a facelift. Then, I found out about Magnet, where I was paired with a small beauty brand that was struggling to get their product photos to look perfect. I was able to take photos for them, add those images to my portfolio, and since then, I just got my first paying client! Thanks Magnet!!"</p>
