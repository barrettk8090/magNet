            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Barrett Kowalsky, a software engineer from Denver, CO. I created this website as a project during my time at Flatiron School. It's meant to serve as a proof of concept for an idea that I had when I was considering changing careers as a Product Photographer. When I was just starting out, I barely had any product images in my online portfolio, so I spent some time cold-calling (read as: emailing) small businesses in Denver, offering to do some test photos of their products for free, solely so that I could build out my portfolio. At the time, the alternative to that was going to Target, buying some expensive (but well-designed) products, and shooting those in hopes of getting noticed. To be honest actually, I did do that, and it didn't go great. </p>

            <p>What did go great, though, was getting in touch with some very VERY small business owners. For example, I connected with a woman based outside of Denver who was trying to get her handmade soap business off the ground. Her products were great, but she was not a product photographer herself. I offered to take some photos for her, at no cost, in the hopes that we would both benefit: she'd get some nicer product images, and I'd get some high-quality images for my own portfolio. She was happy, I was happy, and I didn't have to go to Target. </p>

            <p>The idea then, is to create a space that makes these types of connections more easily. It's a hope to bring people together... like a... um... Magnet. People who are at the VERY beginning of their creative careers could connect with small businesses or individuals working on their side hustles, and find common ground in helping each other out. Think: someone who is new to programming with a bland porfolio, paired with a food truck owner that needs a simple starter website to get off the ground. Or someone looking to get into video editing, paired with a high school football coach who needs a sizzle reel of the team for a school event. Or a product photographer connecting with someone making hand made soaps in their home. You get the point. </p>

            <p>People helping other people. What a concept! </p>

            <p>This website was made with ❤️ using Vite, React, and maybe Tailwind. And lots of coffee and La Croix 🤪</p>
