# Magnet

Magnet is a proof-of-concept website to promote the non-existent Magnet iOS and Android application. The app itself would be meant to connect creatives and small businesses that are just starting out, so that they can build something unique together. The idea for this project came from my own experience in trying to become a freelance product photographer.

This project was created during my time at Flatiron School in Denver, CO. It serves as 1) an example of the types of websites I'm capable of creating after having about only two weeks of experience using React, as well as 2) a reference point of how far I've come to my future self.

This project was built using Vite, React, and Tailwind.
